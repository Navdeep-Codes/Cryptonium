# Cryptonium
## A open source blockchain and with API end points 
### This does not hold any value in the real world it is just made for fun
## Made with 💖 by Navdeep
This is a fully operational bloackchain that u can interact with at cryptonium.navdeepsingh.tech (please dont go one UI the project is very backend heavy).
